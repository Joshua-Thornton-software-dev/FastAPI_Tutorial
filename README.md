# FastAPI_Tutorial
I was originally led to believe that while following the tutorial at the URL shown below, I would be creating a mock dashboard for stocks. I am not completely sure why I thought that to be true, but it clearly is not. Still, I will keep the name stock_dash for this tutorial project, and perhaps I will convert it to a mock stock dashboard once the tutorial is completed.
